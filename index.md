<!-- this is an html comment -->

his lesson is designed to teach you how to use the command-line to explore the
directories where the data is stored. In this way, you can see what triggers were applied
when the data was taken and what Monte Carlo samples are available for the run period
you are interested in.

You'll also be shown how to do a first-order inspection of some of these datafiles, just to see
what is stored in them.
