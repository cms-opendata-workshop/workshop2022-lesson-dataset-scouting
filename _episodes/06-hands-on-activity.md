Let's review some of the concepts we covered in the previous episodes. You are encouraged
to go back and engage with those episodes in order to answer these questions. 

You can post questions on the Mattermost channel for this exercise or, if you are
doing this exercise in real time, use the "Raise hand" feature on Zoom. 

> ## Let's review! 
> Can you get to the starting page for the CMS Open Data Portal? Can you select
> the CMS data from that page? 
{: .challenge}

> ## Let's review! 
> The bulk of the CMS released data (as of July 2021) covers what years? What was the collision
energy for those years?
{: .challenge}

> ## Let's review!
> What's the difference between *Collision* data and *Simulated* data?
{: .challenge}

> ## Let's review!
> Select the CMS *collision* data for 2012. Select only the AOD data. Do you remember what the AOD data are?
>
> Try to identify five (5) different triggers. What do you think they are triggering on? How do you find out
> what these triggers are actually doing? 
{: .challenge}

> ## Let's review!
> Select the CMS *simulated* data for 2012. Select the **Heavy Gauge Bosons** (under *Filter by category*) and
find a *Zprime* sample. Click on it. These are 
[hypothetical gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%E2%80%B2_and_Z%E2%80%B2_bosons).
>
> How can you learn *about CMS simulated dataset names*? What do you think the Z' is decaying to? 
What is the assumed mass of the Z' in this particular sample?
>
> How many events are in this sample? How much hard drive space does this sample occupy?
